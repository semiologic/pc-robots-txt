DESCRIPTION:
-----------------------------
When activated, this plugin automatically creates a virtual "robots.txt" file for your blog. You can optionally edit the contents of your "robots.txt" file from the plugin admin page.


INSTALLATION
-----------------------------
1. Unpack this archive and copy the "pc-robots-txt" folder and all its contents to your wp-content/plugins/ directory.
2. Go to the WordPress admin pages and click the Plugins menu.
3. Activate the Robots.txt plugin.


INSTRUCTIONS
-----------------------------
Without doing anything except enabling the plugin, you'll have a reasonably effective "robots.txt" file. If you want to make specific changes to the contents of your virtual "robots.txt" file, go to your blog admin section, choose Settings, Robots.txt. You'll then be able to add or delete entries. Make sure you click the "Update Options" button to save any changes you make. Clicking the "Reset Defaults" button will place the default contents back into your "robots.txt" file, and will over-write any changes you have made.


SUPPORT
-----------------------------
With this being a free WordPress plugin there is no offical support, but you can visit my plugins page (http://petercoughlin.com/wordpress-plugins/) for updates, to ask questions, or to submit bugs.
